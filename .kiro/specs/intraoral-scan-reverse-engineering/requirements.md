# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec outlines the systematic reverse engineering and documentation of the IntraoralScan 3.5.4.6 dental scanning application. The goal is to create a comprehensive architecture map that details all components, their relationships, communication patterns, and data flows without decompiling protected executables.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a reverse engineer, I want to inventory all executable and library files, so that I can understand the complete application structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the application THEN the system SHALL catalog all .exe files and their purposes
2. WHEN analyzing the application THEN the system SHALL catalog all .dll files and their dependencies
3. WHEN analyzing the application THEN the system SHALL identify all configuration files and data models
4. WHEN analyzing the application THEN the system SHALL document all AI models and their locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a reverse engineer, I want to classify each process by function, so that I can understand the application's modular architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classifying processes THEN the system SHALL categorize each executable as UI, logic, algorithm, network, or order management
2. WHEN classifying processes THEN the system SHALL identify the main entry point and launcher processes
3. WHEN classifying processes THEN the system SHALL document service processes and their roles
4. WHEN classifying processes THEN the system SHALL map supporting utilities and tools

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reverse engineer, I want to trace inter-process communication patterns, so that I can understand how components interact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracing communication THEN the system SHALL identify IPC mechanisms (pipes, sockets, shared memory)
2. WHEN tracing communication THEN the system SHALL document network endpoints and protocols
3. WHEN tracing communication THEN the system SHALL map data flow between processes
4. WHEN tracing communication THEN the system SHALL identify configuration-based connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a reverse engineer, I want to analyze readable components, so that I can understand application logic and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing readable components THEN the system SHALL examine QML files for UI structure
2. WHEN analyzing readable components THEN the system SHALL analyze Python scripts and modules
3. WHEN analyzing readable components THEN the system SHALL document configuration file formats and contents
4. WHEN analyzing readable components THEN the system SHALL examine database schemas and data
5. WHEN analyzing readable components THEN the system SHALL catalog translation files and supported languages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a reverse engineer, I want to examine binary components safely, so that I can understand core functionality without decompilation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining binary components THEN the system SHALL identify DLL exports and function signatures
2. WHEN examining binary components THEN the system SHALL analyze Python extension modules (.pyd files)
3. WHEN examining binary components THEN the system SHALL document AI model formats and structures
4. WHEN examining binary components THEN the system SHALL trace CUDA and GPU processing paths
5. WHEN examining binary components THEN the system SHALL identify hardware communication interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a reverse engineer, I want to create a comprehensive architecture map, so that I can document the complete system design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the architecture map THEN the system SHALL produce a visual component diagram
2. WHEN creating the architecture map THEN the system SHALL document data flow patterns
3. WHEN creating the architecture map THEN the system SHALL create a process interaction matrix
4. WHEN creating the architecture map THEN the system SHALL document technology stack and dependencies
5. WHEN creating the architecture map THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of key findings and insights
